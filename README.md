# Portfolio Rebalancer

This response to the coding challenge uses JavaScript, with unit tests in Jasmine. There is an HTML GUI that exercises the code (sorry, I know the guidance said no GUI, but it was a quick way to run through some scenarios), and an HTML GUI for the Jasmine test runner.

I don't advocate the use of JavaScript for most things, but I'm not a Java or Ruby developer (C# is my language of choice), so I wouldn't know how to set up an environment, or send you a code sample in a project format you would want.

The core of the solution is provided by the Portfolio JavaScript "class", which exposes instance methods for building and rebalancing a portfolio.
